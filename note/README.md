# Functional Programming using TypeScript's Note

## Functional Programming

### Core Concept

- **Pure Function**
  - Produce the same output when assigned the same input (No Side Effect)
  - **Side-Effect**: You got different output, Althought you assigned the same input.
- Immutability
  - Doing something instead of Modified existing global variables (That made it's mutability).
- First-Class Function
  - Function as a value to a variable (You can assign function to a variable).
- Higher-Order Function
  - Function that has function as "its argument" or "its return value".
- Function Composition
  - Combination of multiple functions to create another function.
